Data Mining techniques:

1. Checked which columns have null values.
2. Replaced the hyphen sign.
3. From Epoch Unix Time feature extracted required fields like timestamp, year, month, hour, day, date, minute, second.
4. Projected Which status code values appears.
5. How many times each status code appears in active directory.
6. Get the transform highly skewed data to an approximate normal distribution to visualize data distribution in more comprehensible manner.
7. Project log transform having the less skewed, giving us a better idea of the distribution of status codes.
8. Showcase the Total number of unique hosts.
9. How many unique hosts visited active directory website in two months
10. Top five hosts making requests on the 3rd day.
And yes  still working on it further.
